32 Do You Remember ?,32 Mo ̱ o dia o mo ̱ nge ̱ le ̱ e ?
Would you not agree that Jehovah is worthy of all the glory and honor that we can give him by offering the best that we have ?,4 : 11 ) Mo ̱ o si memba ná e te ̱ nge ̱ n ná jabeye Yehova nje ye ̱ se ̱ di be ̱ nno ̱ ya mpete ̱ ebanja a dongame ̱ n o kusa sesa n 'edube e ?
"Because of our dedication to Jehovah , we also enjoy "" peace with God , "" a good relationship with him . - Rom .","4 : 6 , 7 ) Je pe ̱ ná di bwane ̱ "" musango na Loba "" muńe ̱ nge ̱ , nika ná mulatako ma bwam na mo ̱ , ońolana di bake ̱ biso ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ na Yehova . - Rom ."
It strongly warns us against isolating ourselves from the congregation .,"5 : 23 , 24 ) E mome ̱ le ̱ biso ̱ na iwiye ̱ ná di si pandise ̱ biso ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ na mwemba ."
What an appropriate symbol of how Jehovah 's righteous standards can protect our figurative heart !,A se ̱ edinge ̱ dinge ̱ e te ̱ nge ̱ n e malee ̱ ne ̱ ni bete ̱ sedi ba Yehova be te ̱ m na sim be matatano ̱ mulema masu ma mudī e !
He viewed marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman .,A ta e ̱ ne ̱ diba la mome na muto ka mulatako mwe bosangi .
"As a result , the upright are able to "" understand what is righteous and just and fair , the entire course of what is good . ""","Bambale ̱ be so ̱ ná ba "" so ̱ ṅtane ̱ mbale ̱ na muka mu te ̱ m , nje e te ̱ nge ̱ n na nge 'a bwam te ̱ . """
That decision gave renewed vigor to the preaching work .,Be bedomsedi be batedi biso ̱ ngińa o ebol 'a dikalo .
"The most important one , of course , is that of Jesus .","Bena be mweńa buka be ̱ se ̱ , bepumbwedi ba Yesu ."
Our situation is not like that of a prisoner who is waiting in his cell for his execution .,Bete ̱ medi basu be titi ka ba mot 'a beboa ńe o jenge ̱ le ̱ ponda a me ̱ nde ̱ no ̱ bwabe ̱ .
"Knowing this helps us "" endure fully with patience and joy . "" - Col .","Bia la nika di mongwane ̱ biso ̱ "" o be ̱ titimbe ̱ ńe ̱ se ̱ na we ̱ lisane ̱ na [ "" muńe ̱ nge ̱ , "" NW ] . "" - Kol ."
We know that it is possible only because Jehovah is backing the work . - Job 42 : 2 .,Di bi ná nika ńe nde ná e bolane ̱ buka te ̱ ońolana Yehova a masue ̱ le ̱ y 'ebolo . - Hiob 42 : 2 .
"When we open our mouth wide and sing out , we are able to sing louder . - w17.11 , p .","Di tele ̱ te ̱ mudumbu na mungo ̱ ngi masu ńai a bwam o lo ̱ ngo ̱ , je ná di we ̱ le ̱ lo ̱ ngo ̱ na doi la mo ̱ ń . - w17.11 , dip ."
Godly wisdom helped him to grasp the principle of relative subjection to secular authorities .,"Dibie ̱ la Loba longwane ̱ mo ̱ o so ̱ ṅtane ̱ bete ̱ sedi ba se ̱ le ̱ sengane ̱ Yehova , denge ̱ to ̱ njika mwanedi nupe ̱ pe ̱ ."
"We are told : "" Yet , he [ Jehovah ] did not give him [ Abraham ] any inheritance in it , no , not even enough to put his foot on ; but he promised to give it to him as a possession and after him to his offspring , though as yet he had no child . ""","E langwabe ̱ biso ̱ ná : "" A [ Yehova ] si ta a bola mo ̱ [ Abraham ] sango oten to ̱ tanga diwo ̱ , nde a ta a kakane ̱ ná a mabola mo ̱ mo ̱ na mbot 'ao ni mawe ̱ mo ̱ ombusa , niponda ke ̱ a si yai to ̱ muna . """
My construction group is like a family .,Epep 'am ya longa ye nde mba ka mbia .
"That lesson no doubt made a deep impression on Paul , as evidenced by what he later wrote to the brothers in Philippi about anxiety and the peace of God .","Esibe ̱ penda , be belēdi be maki Paulo , ka nje te ̱ nika e me ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ no ̱ o leta a tiledino ̱ bonasango ba Filipi ombus 'a ponda jombwea mutaka na musango ma Loba ."
"The longer we walk with Jehovah , the deeper our modesty should become .","Etum te ̱ di madangwano ̱ na Loba , sibise ̱ lasu la ńolo pe ̱ di mabata nde be ̱ bonde ̱ ne ̱ ."
"Today , most of us are surrounded by prejudice .",Jita lasu nin we ̱ nge ̱ di dingabe ̱ le ̱ na ndando .
The first article explains what modesty is and what it is not .,"Jokwa laboso di matele ̱ ye ̱ nje sibise ̱ la ńolo jeno ̱ , na nje di titino ̱ ."
"For example , Zion 's Watch Tower of March 1 , 1902 , mentioned one , saying : "" As to Paul 's personal appearance : . . .","K 'eyembilan , Zion 's Watch Tower ( Njongo a Betatedi ) ná 1 bwa So ̱ ṅe ̱ 1902 , e to ̱ pedi diwo ̱ , mo ̱ ná : "" Jombwea je ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ la Paulo : . . ."
"Just as Jehovah put an end to all the immoral activities back then , so he will put an end to similar wrongdoing today when he brings judgment against this present system of things .","Ka nje te ̱ Yehova a bo ̱ le ̱ no ̱ beboledi ba mbamba o mi mińa , nika pe ̱ nde a me ̱ nde ̱ no ̱ bo ̱ le ̱ milemlem ma beboledi ba bobe we ̱ nge ̱ ponda a me ̱ nde ̱ no ̱ kaise ̱ yen ebe ̱ yed 'a mambo ya we ̱ nge ̱ ."
So another suggestion is to open your mouth wider than you do for normal speaking .,Malea mape ̱ pe ̱ me nde ná o tele ̱ mudumbu buka nje o yo ̱ kino ̱ tele ̱ mo ̱ ke ̱ o mato ̱ po ̱ .
"When things go wrong , they tend to blame others rather than accept responsibility .","Mambo ma si madangwa te ̱ bwam , ba manuma nde bape ̱ pe ̱ njo ̱ m o mulopo ma jemea bambe ̱ mu m 'bē ̱ ."
"The helmet worn by the Roman infantry was designed to ward off blows directed at the head , neck , and face .","Mbidi sonj 'a bila ya Roma i tano ̱ i bo ̱ to ̱ mu ta mu longabe ̱ ńai mu makudumane ̱ no ̱ mo ̱ mulopo , ńingo , na boso ."
"Throughout the earth , Jehovah 's Witnesses express godly love toward others .",Mboṅ a Yehova i malee ̱ le ̱ bape ̱ pe ̱ ndol 'a Loba o wase ńe ̱ se ̱ .
""" If my husband and I feel a little disconnected from the congregation , "" she says , "" we pray specifically to Jehovah , ' Please let us know if we are doing something that makes it hard for others to be drawn to us . '","Mo ̱ ná : "" Biso ̱ na mom 'am di ta nde je ̱ ne ̱ biana di titi belongi ba mwemba . Di kane ̱ Yehova tobotobo ońola nika , na ben byala ná ' Son , bola ná di bie nga je o bola mambo ma meke ̱ bape ̱ pe ̱ ná ba siseye biso ̱ o mbasan . '"
"I have to admit that I did not really want to change my assignment and enter the circuit work , but Jehovah had something else in mind . ""","Na si ta na be ̱ ne ̱ ńo ̱ ngi o jese ̱ le ̱ ebol 'a paonia o botea y 'ebondo , nde Yehova a ta a be ̱ ne ̱ mwano mupe ̱ pe ̱ . """
"Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ' Your love is not great enough to reach me .","Nde , na ta nde na langwea mo ̱ ná : ' Ndol 'ango ̱ e si kolo ńai e matapano ̱ mba ."
"However , their humility and their trust in Jehovah were likely put to the test by an unexpected turn of events .","Nde , sibise ̱ labu la ńolo na lakisane ̱ ba tano ̱ ba be ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ Yehova ba ta ba we ̱ le ̱ be ̱ o kekise ̱ ońola nje e bolane ̱ ombusa ponda ."
"But in his time , the common people in England had virtually no access to the Bible .","Nde o mi mińa , beye ̱ me ̱ ki ba bato o ekombo a Inglisi be si ta be we ̱ le ̱ be ̱ ne ̱ Bibe ̱ l ."
"Then , work in harmony with your prayers , perhaps keeping study periods rather short .","Nde o we ̱ pe ̱ ná o bole bupisane ̱ muka mo ̱ ngo ̱ , we ná o botea na wutise ̱ pond 'a jokwa ."
The great tribulation will begin when the political elements turn against all false religious organizations as represented by the prostitute called Babylon the Great .,Ndenge ̱ ninde ̱ ne ̱ e me ̱ nde ̱ nde botea niponda bebokedi ba politik be me ̱ nde ̱ no ̱ yo ̱ mbea bebokedi ba ebasi e kwedi be eyemban a mut 'a mbamba nu belabe ̱ ná Babilon Ninde ̱ ne ̱ .

Then an added way that you can demonstrate courage and reliance on Jehovah is by helping your child to do the same . - 1 Sam .,Ngiń 'ango ̱ ńa mulema na lakisane ̱ o be ̱ ne ̱ nno ̱ Yehova ba matute ̱ le ̱ bana bo ̱ ngo ̱ o bola mulemlem . - 1 Sam .

"On the other hand , the tribes of Reuben , Dan , and Asher were each singled out at Judges 5 : 15 - 17 for giving more attention to their own material interests - as represented by their flocks , ships , and harbors - than to the work that Jehovah was having done .","5 : 11 ) O mune ̱ mudi , o Bakaisedi 5 : 15 - 17 di malanga oten ná matumba ma Rube ̱ n , Dan , na Ase ̱ r ma po ̱ si nde o jombwea mambo mabu ma babo ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ ka mabemba mabu , mido ̱ ngi , na myo ̱ lo ̱ mabu - o mulopo ma jombwea ebolo Yehova a tano ̱ a bola ."
The apostle Paul felt this pain and agony deeply .,6 : 23 ) Ńamuloloma Paulo a sengi sese ńa be ̱ mukom a bobe .
"This meant sacrifice on his part .

"These false comforters claimed that our efforts to serve Jehovah loyally are of no benefit to him at all , that our value to God is no more than that of a moth , a maggot , or a worm .","Ban balo ̱ kedi ba mawo ̱ ndo ̱ n ba kai ná miwe ̱ n masu o bolea Yehova na jemea mi si be ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ mo ̱ muse ̱ ṅ to ̱ mō ̱ , ná se ̱ le ̱ ke ̱ , muwu , to ̱ so ̱ mulo ̱ mbi be mo ̱ mweńa o miso ̱ buka biso ̱ ."
"They are led to believe that advanced education opens the door to high - paying and prestigious jobs , and statistics are often presented to show the gap in earnings between graduates from such institutions and those who completed only basic schooling .",Bato ba malangwea babo ̱ ná besukulu bende ̱ ne ̱ be mabola ná be kuse bebolo bende ̱ ne ̱ na musawedi munde ̱ ne ̱ .

Zechariah 's sixth vision has helped us to see that lovers of Jehovah should not engage in any kind of stealing or make false oaths .,Je ̱ ne ̱ di londe ̱ mutoba la Sakaria jongwane ̱ biso ̱ o je ̱ ne ̱ ná bato ̱ nde ̱ Yehova ba pandise ̱ babo ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ na pat 'a jiba ye ̱ se ̱ na makakane ̱ ma mpoṅ .

We drank putrid water and ate mostly lentils and eggplants .,"Di ta nde di ńo ̱ madiba ma mbindo , di da pe ̱ mato ̱ bo ̱ na nginge ."
So it seems that Jesus was asking him where his true affection lay .,E me ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ biana Yesu a ta nde a baise ̱ mo ̱ nje a to ̱ ndino ̱ buka me ̱ se ̱ .
He thinks about the people of Philippi .,E o jo ̱ nge ̱ le ̱ bato ba Filipi .
He simply recognized and accepted his changing circumstances and his limitations .,Embi nde moyo mao emea pe ̱ ná bete ̱ medi bao be mátukwa .

We are keenly aware that the fault may lie in our imperfect view of matters .,Di bi bwambwam ná je ̱ ne ̱ lasu la mambo lena di titi ke ̱ nge ̱ nge ̱ je ná di bola ná je ̱ ne ̱ ná diwuse ̱ di tombi .
Let us contrast godly love with the love described at 2 Timothy 3 : 2 - 4 .,Di kobisane ̱ te ̱ ndol 'a Loba na ndolo ni kwalabe ̱ o 2 Timoteo 3 : 2 - 4 .
"May we join our voices with those of God 's faithful heavenly creatures in saying : "" Let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever .","Di late so ̱ madoi masu na ma bewekedi ba Loba ba jemea be o mo ̱ ń o kwala ná : "" Amen .

Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .,Dongo la ponda a mubise ̱ biso ̱ tongwea na bola nje di si menge ̱ le ̱ no ̱ .
And at times a fit of anger may be followed by a prolonged period of depression .,"Dongo la ponda pe ̱ , malinga mande ̱ ne ̱ me ná ma wana diboa la mo ̱ nge ̱ le ̱ pond 'a bwaba ."
Imagine the people of Meroz catching sight of this vicious warrior as he ran right through their streets alone and desperate .,Dutea te ̱ ná bato ba Meros be o je ̱ ne ̱ ne ̱ ni nun mot 'a bwemba ńa njo eno ̱ o ńa mīla o mangea mabu o sunga longe ̱ lao .
We can learn a lot from some individuals mentioned in the Bible who were real friends but whose friendship was later in danger .,"Je ná jokwa eyeka na byembilan ba bato bō ̱ Bibe ̱ l e mato ̱ peano ̱ , bena ba ta nde mako ̱ m ma mbale ̱ , nde o pondapo ̱ mulatako mabu ma diko ̱ m mu be ̱ o bete ̱ medi be nde ̱ nde ̱ le ̱ ."
We may also find ourselves at greater risk if we are depressed and vulnerable .,Je pe ̱ ná di be ̱ o bete ̱ medi be nde ̱ nde ̱ le ̱ yete ̱ na di ńo ̱ sedi o mudī .
"The first of these articles discusses the difficult situation of our brothers and sisters who have become refugees , and it provides practical suggestions on how we can best help them .","Jokwa laboso la man di makwalea ońola bete ̱ medi ba ndutu ba bonasango na bonańango asu bena ba timbi bawase ̱ diwutamea , di mabola pe ̱ malea ma ne ̱ ni jeno ̱ ná jongwane ̱ babo ̱ ńai a bwam ."

"As a young man , I gave little thought to the purpose of life or to the future .","Ka eso ̱ mbe ̱ , na si ta na dutea jombwea janda la longe ̱ to ̱ kie ̱ le ̱ ni maye ̱ ."
"As a perfect man , Jesus could save humankind from sin and death by dying in their behalf .","Ka moto ńe ke ̱ nge ̱ nge ̱ , Yesu a wusa wo ̱ ońola mbel 'a moto o sunga mo ̱ na bobe na kwedi ."

"The fact is , young ones can win , and they are winning !","Mbale ̱ ńe nde ná , beso ̱ mbe ̱ be ná be buka , nde be pe ̱ o buka !"
This opposition could affect peaceful relations among family members .,Mi mitakisan me ná mi sumwa musango oteten a mbia .

"As a result , such worship unites people in happy congregations and a happy worldwide brotherhood . - Read Isaiah 65 : 13 , 14 .","Ni ńai a jowe ̱ di malata bato , di wana bonam o mwemba , na mbia ma bonasango ma wase ńe ̱ se ̱ mwe bonam . - Langa Yesaya 65 : 13 , 14 ."
Soon Brother Hardaker invited me to accompany him in the field ministry .,"Nika e si no ̱ ngi pond 'a bwaba , na Hardaker a bele ̱ mba o die ̱ le ̱ mo ̱ o dikalo ."

"In the Bible , modesty similarly refers to having a proper estimate of ourselves and an awareness of our limitations .","O Bibe ̱ l , sibise ̱ la ńolo di mapula nde kwala moto nu si malange ̱ mo ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ bonde ̱ ne ̱ buka dime ̱ ne ̱ , nu bi myoyo mao ."

"Beyond the Gospel accounts of Jesus ' burial , the Bible mentions Joseph of Arimathea no more , leading to the obvious question : What became of him ?","Ombusa pulame ̱ la Yesu , Bibe ̱ l e si makwalea pe ̱ ońola Yose ̱ f ńa Arimatia ; myuedi me so ̱ nde ná : Nje e po ̱ yedi mo ̱ e ?"

"Like David , Jehovah 's people today strive to show humility .","Mulemlem kana David , baboledi ba Yehova we ̱ nge ̱ ba mawe ̱ ná ba be ̱ ne ̱ sibise ̱ la ńolo ."
Jesus ' illustration of the unrighteous steward is thought - provoking .,Munia ma Yesu jombwea muboledi nu titi mbale ̱ mu matute ̱ le ̱ biso ̱ o dutea .
His message could divide people .,Mwe ̱ ndi mao mu ta mu be ̱ ne ̱ ngińa o jaba bato .

"The way the wicked brutalize children , the elderly , and other defenseless ones fills us with horror .","Njo babobe ba mabolane ̱ no ̱ bana , badun , to ̱ so ̱ bape ̱ pe ̱ bena ba si be ̱ n ngudi o sunga ńolo e masouse ̱ biso ̱ na bo ̱ ngo ̱ ."
"When it comes to freedom , a key point for us to bear in mind is that Jehovah God alone has what can be called absolute and unlimited freedom .","O nje e mombweye ̱ wonja , to ̱ ti la mweńa di s 'angame ̱ nno ̱ dimbea le nde ná Yehova Loba mo ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ mō ̱ nde a be ̱ n wonja ni londi mbom , na ni si be ̱ n myoyo ."
"In addition , many people believe that global corruption has worsened .","Omo ̱ ń a nika , jita ba dube ̱ ná ka ni titi mbale ̱ pe ̱ e bati ńaka ."

Choosing to walk modestly with God will therefore help us to think neither too much nor too little of ourselves . - Read Romans 12 : 3 .,"( Mye . 18 : 36 ) Po ̱ so ̱ o dangwa na sibise ̱ la ńolo oboso ba Loba , di me ̱ nde ̱ jongwane ̱ biso ̱ ná di si langa biso ̱ me ̱ ne ̱ mweńa jita to ̱ so ̱ bosadi jita . - Langa Roma 12 : 3 ."

Living up to one 's dedication involves hard work .,E mapula miwe ̱ n jita ná moto a die ̱ le ̱ longe ̱ lao kaponda kakane ̱ a bolino ̱ .

"And just as Jehoshaphat went to the territory of Ephraim to help people return to true worship , we can reach out to those who have become inactive .","Ka ne ̱ ni te ̱ Yosafat a yo ̱ mbino ̱ o mindi ma Efraim o jongwane ̱ bato ná ba timbe pe ̱ te ̱ na jowe ̱ la mbale ̱ , je ná di sambise ̱ ban ba temam o mudī dia , nika ná ba bena ba si mate ̱ pe ̱ dikalo ."
